# 🌫️ Air Pollution Analysis with Time-Series Modeling

This project applies **statistical time-series modeling** to environmental data, focusing on **air pollution trends**.  
It uses a Jupyter notebook written in **R** to preprocess the dataset, identify appropriate models, estimate parameters, and perform residual analysis.

## ✨ Key Contents

### Notebook
- **`TimeSeriesProject.ipynb`** (written in **R**)  
  Contains the complete statistical modeling workflow, structured into sections:  
  - **Preprocessing** — handling time-series structure and preparing pollutant data  
  - **Model Identification** — exploring candidate ARIMA-like models  
  - **Parameter Estimation** — fitting models to the data  
  - **Residual Analysis** — validating model adequacy  
  - **Statistical Tests** — e.g., Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for residual distribution

### Dataset
- **`Time-Series-Dataset-University-of-Tehran.xlsx`**  
  Hourly measurements of air pollutants (e.g., O3, NO, NO2, SO2, PM2.5) with timestamps in the Persian calendar.

## 🎯 Research Context
Developed as part of a **study in statistical modeling and time-series analysis**, this project demonstrates:  
- How to apply ARIMA-style techniques to environmental datasets  
- Validation of models through residual analysis and statistical tests  
- Practical use of **R in Jupyter** for reproducible research workflows
